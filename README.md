# Project-2

I used Darksky API to get the weather conditions of New York. In relation to my first project, I wanted to use a an API that the user can use to play around with the weather. I used the wind data to create a windvane of sorts to visualize the direction and intensity of the wind. Here users can control the time, epoch, sunrise time, sunset time, and temperature. The music I used was from the sound track "Weathering with you" by Radwimps.
